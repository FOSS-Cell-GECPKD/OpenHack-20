# Program Overview

To kickoff the program, a workshop would be hosted by Anand Baburajan and Abijith Bahuleyan on 5th September which would give you an understanding on FOSS, git, GitHub, open source contributions and OpenHack.

How to participate?

1. **Make sure you have a GitHub account or create one** We will be using GitHub for hosting the code, collaboration, reviews, etc. 
2. **Join** [**FOSS Cell's Gitter chatroom**](https://gitter.im/FOSS-Cell-GECPKD/community) **using your GitHub account** Apart from the Whatsapp group where you've been already added, technical doubts, suggestions, etc are welcome at the Gitter chatroom. 
3. **Accept the mail invitation to join FOSS Cell, GEC PKD org on GitHub** That's where your projects would be hosted. 
4. **Choose your project** Select one or more projects you'd like to work on from the [projects page](https://openhack.gitbook.io/openhack-20/cohort-1/projects). You are also welcome to suggest new ideas. 
5. **Join your project's Gitter chatroom** Once we create a repo \(repository\) for your project, you need to join its Gitter chatroom using the button in your project's readme since project related communication would take place in the project chatrooms. 
6. **Discuss roles** You can divide your project into smaller meaningful parts after dicussing with your mentors then divide the roles among your team. Your project should also have a maintainer who would look after the project, goals, contributions, etc. 
7. **Sign up for GitHub's** [**student education pack**](https://education.github.com/pack) ****The education pack provides free access to a lot of really helpful resources while you're a student. Make sure you use your college email ID while signing up. 
8. **Start building** Have discussions in your chatrooms or video calls and start building! 
9. **Follow best practices** One of the goals of OpenHack is to inclulcate best coding and open source practices among student developers. The mentors will review your pull requests \(your code contributions\) and provide you with suggestions on best practices. They will also open an issue titled "Best practices TODO" at your project's repo which is a list of things you need to take care of before submitting your project for the final review. 
10. **Attend weekly stand-ups** We'll have meetings at 4PM every Saturday where all the OpenHackers would introduce themselves, what they've been upto the previous week, how their projects are going, any interesting challenge they faced, etc. So be sure to attend the stand-ups! We will also have show-and-tells where teams would explain their projects in detail along with what they learnt and the challenges they faced. All the meets will be uploaded to our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWFTHKmCRTlBx-XWhHuGSKg).
