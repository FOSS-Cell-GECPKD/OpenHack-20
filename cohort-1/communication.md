# Communication

We will be using WhatsApp for both general and off-topic chat and all the participants would be added to OpenHack's WhatsApp group. Technical doubts and discussions are welcome at FOSS Cell's [Gitter chatroom](https://gitter.im/FOSS-Cell-GECPKD/community).

Your project would also have an associated Gitter chatroom integrated with the GitHub repo. For the weekly stand-ups and show-and-tells, we will be using Jitsi Meet and all the sessions would be uploaded to OpenHack's [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWFTHKmCRTlBx-XWhHuGSKg).

Please check our code of conduct [here](https://openhack.gitbook.io/openhack-20/code-of-conduct).
