I have to mention the amount of efforts Anand put into mentoring me as a beginner by having daily calls, helping me with starting up, listening patiently and helping me out every time I got really stuck. I'm grateful for the time and effort he put into making me realize my mistakes and for encouraging me to keep pushing myself to do challenging things. The constant sharing of resources, blogs, videos, his long TED talks etc., gave me a lot of exposure and I learnt a lot. I'm happy that I was able to open my first ever PR at Serenity OS without any prior experience. I wrote my first ever blog post to inspire students to contribute to open source. I built a few projects, contributed to Open-MSS‚Å† and applied for GSoC there. I'm happy that I met Anand in my first year of college!
