OpenHack '20 is a program conducted at GEC Palakkad which offers students an opportunity to build open source projects at the FOSS Cell and contribute to major open source projects under the guidance of mentors. Students get to learn the git workflow, explore new languages, frameworks & tools, improve leadership and collaboration skills while following best coding and open-source practices. This would help them build a strong foundation for their early career and walk away with an amazing experience to put on their resume.
