OpenHack '20 is a three month program conducted at GEC Palakkad which offers students an opportunity to build open source projects under the FOSS Cell. Students get to learn the git workflow, new languages/frameworks, improve leadership and collaboration skills while following best open source practices. This will also help them prepare for programs like Google Summer of Code and the MLH Fellowship.

## How to participate?

1. Create a GitHub account
2. Join the FOSS Cell's Gitter community chat room using your GitHub account: https://gitter.im/FOSS-Cell-GECPKD/community
3. We'll send an invite to you by mail for joining FOSS Cell's Github org
4. Select one or more projects you'd like to work on from the list given below (you can also suggest a new idea)
5. There are repositories for all the projects and you can join the Gitter chat room using the button in your project's readme.
6. Select the maintainer of your project from your team and let us know
7. Sign up for GitHub student education pack with your COLLEGE email ID: https://education.github.com/pack (free access to lot of helpful resources while you're a student)
8. Have discussions with your team in your Gitter chatrooms
9. Start building!
10. Attend weekly meetings and show-and-tells with all OpenHack '20 participants to discuss your progress

## How to select a project?

Choose something you'd like to build or are passionate about. Don't go with a project just because it uses a language/framework you already know or just because there's an 'experienced' senior in the project. The program is 2 months long so you've plenty of time to learn a new language/framework. You're also welcome to suggest your own ideas!!

## List of projects

### [Blog for the FOSS Cell](https://github.com/FOSS-Cell-GECPKD/foss-blog)

## What should I do after finishing OpenHack '20?

Congratulations!! You can find existing open source projects in the fields you're interested in and try contributing. Try exploring projects on GitHub or check out organisations participating in GSoC. Most of the projects would have issues labeled 'beginner-friendly-issues' or 'good-first-issues'.

## Few ways of contributing to existing projects:

1. Check out good-first-issues
2. Find bugs and fix them
3. Improve the documentation which will help a lot of other people using the library/software.
4. If you're using the software/library and you need a feature, you can get in touch with the community, request for the feature and code it up.
5. Add tests

## Popular and really fulfilling open source programs:

1. Google Summer of Code: https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/
2. MLH Fellowship: https://fellowship.mlh.io/
3. Outreachy: https://www.outreachy.org/
4. CommunityBridge: https://communitybridge.org/

## Check us out on YouTube!

OpenHack participants attend weekly stand-ups, host workshops and more: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWFTHKmCRTlBx-XWhHuGSKg

-------

Top 3 contributors would be awarded and everyone who successfully completes their projects while following the suggested best coding & collaboration practices would be rewarded with certificates for their invaluable open source contributions. The top 3 students would be judged on criterias like quality of contributions, good communication, helping others, contributing to existing open source projects, etc.

For doubts, feel free to contact [@AnandBaburajan](https://github.com/anandbaburajan/) (Anand Baburajan) or  [@twentyse7en](https://github.com/twentyse7en/)  (Abijith Bahuleyan) at Gitter.

May the source be with you!
