# OpenHack '20
OpenHack '20 is a two month program conducted at GEC Palakkad which offers students an opportunity to build open source projects under the FOSS Cell. Students get to learn the git workflow, new languages/frameworks, improve leadership and collaboration skills while following best open source practices. This will also help them prepare for programs like Google Summer of Code and the MLH Fellowship.

## How to participate?

1. Create a GitHub account
2. Join the FOSS Cell's Gitter community chat room using your GitHub account: https://gitter.im/FOSS-Cell-GECPKD/community
3. We'll send an invite to you by mail for joining FOSS Cell's Github org
4. Select one or more projects you'd like to work on from the list given below
5. Create a repository for your project at FOSS Cell's org on GitHub (we'll provide the separate Gitter chat room for your project)
6. Get a better understanding of the git workflow
7. Sign up for GitHub student education pack with your COLLEGE email ID: https://education.github.com/pack (free access to lot of helpful resources while you're a student)
8. Have discussions with your team and divide the work
9. Start building!
10. Attend weekly meetings with all OpenHack '20 participants to discuss your progress

## How to select a project idea?

Choose something you'd like to build or are passionate about. Don't go with an idea just because it uses a language/framework you already know. The program is 2 months long so you've plenty of time a new language/framework. You're also welcome to suggest your own ideas!!

## List of project ideas

### Blog for the FOSS Cell

A blog mainly for freshers (1st year students) at our college to make them aware of good CSE opportunities, things they could do/shouldn't do to become better at CSE, communities and all sorts of things which a CSE junior would find helpful.

Tech stack: Jekyll & GitHub Pages -- or -- Django, Javascript, Postgres, Heroku, any web framework like React.js, Vue.js etc (if feasible)

-------

### Crafting an interpreter

Students would implement the Lox programming language from scratch

Tech stack: Python | Domain knowledge: Interpreters

-------

### Algorithms Visualizer

Visualisation of common/popular/interesting algorithms in a Web app, p5.js, etc. You'd get practical knowledge of how to apply algos in real life. For example, finding paths in a maze, map problems, dynamic programming problems, etc. Can be static or interactive, up to you.

Tech stack: Javascript, any web framework like React.js, Vue.js etc. | Domain knowledge: Basics of algorithms

-------

### Lifetree:

A beautiful visualisation of a person's life as a tree (similar to git). You can create new branches, merge branches, commit, etc.
Interesting blog about git: https://medium.com/girl-writes-code/git-is-a-directed-acyclic-graph-and-what-the-heck-does-that-mean-b6c8dec65059

Tech stack: Javascript, any web framework like React.js, Vue.js etc. | Domain knowledge: Basics of trees (data structure), basics of git

-------

### Image steganography app:

Hiding data in images. It would be in the form of an app with a front-end to input images and a back-end to return the processed images.

Tech stack: Javascript, any web framework like React.js, Vue.js etc, Python, Flask (micro web framework for Python), NumPy and OpenCV can be used too | Domain knowledge: Basics of cryptography

-------

### Real-time chat app:

A web app using sockets to implement real-time communication

Tech stack: Javascript, any web framework like React.js, Vue.js etc, socket.io

-------

### Resume generator app:

A web app to generate resumes using tempates according to user input

Tech stack: Javascript, any web framework like React.js, Vue.js etc, with Bootstrap or Material-UI

-------

### Website to buy/sell second-hand books:

The title says it all.

Tech stack: Javascript, Angular, Bootstrap, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB

-------

### Self-destructing one-time play video format:

A format which allows users to play the video only once, after which it self-destructs.

Tech stack: C/C++

-------

### More ideas.....:

....

Tech stack: ...

-------

Note: You're welcome to use any language/framework you like as long as the project's goal remains the same!

## What should I do after finishing OpenHack '20?

Congratulations!! You can find existing open source projects in the fields you're interested in and try contributing. Try exploring projects on GitHub or check out organisations participating in GSoC. Most of the projects would have issues labeled 'beginner-friendly-issues' or 'good-first-issues'.

## Few ways of contributing to existing projects:

1. Check out good-first-issues
2. Find bugs and fix them
3. Improve the documentation which will help a lot of other people using the library/software.
4. If you're using the software/library and you need a feature, you can get in touch with the community, request for the feature and code it up.
5. Add tests

## Popular and really fulfilling open source programs:

1. Google Summer of Code: https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/
2. MLH Fellowship: https://fellowship.mlh.io/

-------

Top 3 contributors would be awarded and everyone who successfully completes their projects would be rewarded with certificates for their invaluable open source contributions. (Extra points to those who also start contributing to existing open source projects! :D)

For doubts, feel free to contact [@AnandBaburajan](https://github.com/anandbaburajan/) (Anand Baburajan) or  [@twentyse7en](https://github.com/twentyse7en/)  (Abijith Bahuleyan) at Gitter.

May the source be with you!
