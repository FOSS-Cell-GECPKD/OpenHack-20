# Communication

We will be using Discord for all general, off-topic chat, technical doubts and feedback-requests. The invite link will be shared to all the participants.

**Channels:**

* **announcements** - all the important updates on events, workshops, meets, etc
* **general** - anything related to the program, coding, doubts, projects, etc.
* **introduce-yourself** - share your name, GitHub username, facts about you, etc.
* **git-and-github** - doubts related to Git & GitHub
* **alpha-track** - anything related to the Alpha Track
* **beta-track** - anything related to the Beta Track
* **feedback-requests** - if you need feedback on choices, resume, applications, etc
* **off-topic** - anything unrelated to the program! :D

Your project would also have an associated Gitter chatroom integrated with the GitHub repo. For the weekly stand-ups and show-and-tells, we will be using Jitsi Meet and all the sessions would be uploaded to OpenHack's [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWFTHKmCRTlBx-XWhHuGSKg).
