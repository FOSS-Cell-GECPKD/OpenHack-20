# Post OpenHack TODO List

Congratulations on completing OpenHack '20! We hope you learned a lot, worked on interesting projects, made good friends and built a strong foundation for your early career! You'll be receiving a completion certificate via mail soon. 

What next?

* **Update your resume and social media accounts** The work you did over the last few months is a great way to showcase your skills to future employers. Remember to mention "OpenHack '20 developer" as the title and "FOSS Cell, GEC PKD" as the organisation name then put a few points in the description about the work you did. You can include the links to your project's repo and demo too. If you've also been a mentor at OpenHack '20, be sure to mention it as "OpenHack '20 mentor". 
* **Improve your project and help out contributors** Make sure to keep your project alive by maintaining it, adding new features etc. You can also try to help out future contributors by clearing their doubts, reviewing PRs, etc. 
* **Become a mentor and help others** You can give back to the community by helping others, getting them excited with open source, etc! You're also welcome to join next time as a mentor! 
* **Find open source projects** You can find other open source projects in the fields you're interested in and try contributing to them. You can contribute to open source projects you use, explore new projects on GitHub, etc.  Here are a few ways of contributing to existing projects:
  1. Check out good-first-issues/beginner-friendly-issues
  2. Find bugs and fix them
  3. Improve the documentation which will help a lot of other people using the library/software/framework.
  4. If you're using the project and need a feature, you can get in touch with the community, request for the feature and even code it up.
