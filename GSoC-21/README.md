# Getting started for GSoC '21
The best way to get started would be to check out https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/ thoroughly, especially the FAQ and resources sections. 

## Instructions

1. Check out all of the GSoC '20 organisations [here](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2020/organizations/)
2. Select 1-3 orgs you find interesting and which use tech/languages/skills you've or can be learnt in 1-3 months
3. Fork this repo, clone it and create `your_name_here.md` file inside the `GSoC-21` folder. For example: `Anand.md`

Inside the file, enter the following details:

- Organisation name
- Relevant tech/languages/skills involved at this org
- Between 1 and 10, how competent are you presently to contribute to the org?
- Why do you want to apply for this organization? (min: 30 words)
- How many hours per week are you putting in learning and contributing to the org?
- Will you keep contributing to this org if you aren't selected for GSoC '21?
- If you're selected in this org for GSoC '21, will you keep contributing after GSoC is over?
- Any PRs opened? (If yes, provide links to your PRs)
- Any issues opened? (If yes, provide links to the issues)
- Anything else you want to mention/ask?

Once you've added the details, open a PR and we'll check it out and get back to you. The PR is to track your goals and progress so it won't be merged. You can edit your file with updates or add more organisations and push to your PR.
