# Communication

We will be using WhatsApp for general/program-related/off-topic chat and all the participants would be added to OpenHack's WhatsApp group. Technical doubts/discussions/suggestions are welcome at FOSS Cell's [Gitter chatroom](https://gitter.im/FOSS-Cell-GECPKD/community).

Your project team would have an associated Gitter chatroom integrated with your project's GitHub repo. You can also ping your mentors if you've personal doubts.

For the weekly stand-ups and show-and-tells, we will be using Jitsi Meet and all the sessions are uploaded to OpenHack's [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWFTHKmCRTlBx-XWhHuGSKg).

If you have questions/doubt specific to you alone, you can contact:  
Anand Baburajan \(Program Manager, OpenHack '20\) via [email](mailto:anandbaburajan@gmail.com) or at [Gitter](https://gitter.im/anandbaburajan).
